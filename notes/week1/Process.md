## Chapter 4 - The Abstraction: The Process

**Abstraction**
    - Abstraction is all about hiding complexity and letting you focus on what you need to do, rather than how itâ€™s done. It makes your code simpler, easier to read, and more maintainable!

**Process**: The most fundamental abstraction that the OS provides to users.
    - Def: quite simple, it's a running "program".
    - program is lifeless, sits on the disk, waiting to spring into action.
    - OS takes these bytes and gets them running, transforming the "program" into something useful.

**Virtualization**
    - The OS creates the illusion that many processes are running at the same time by **virtualizing** the CPU.
    - Def: Virtualization is the creation of virtual versions of physical resources, like computers or servers, allowing multiple independent systems to run on a single physical machine efficiently.
    - Ex:  Virtualization is like pretending you have multiple computers inside one real computer. Imagine you have a powerful computer, and you use special software to divide it into smaller "virtual" computers. Each virtual computer can run its own programs and even a different operating system (like Windows, Linux, or macOS).
    - To implement virtualization of the CPU, and to implement it well, the OS will need both some low-level machinery and some high-level intelligence. We call the low-level machinery mechanisms; mechanisms are low-level methods or protocols that implement a needed piece of functionality.

**Time Sharing**
    - Def: Time sharing is a basic technique used by an OS to share a resource. By allowing the resource to be used for a little while by one entity, and then a little while by another, and so forth, the resource in question (e.g., the CPU, or a network link) can be shared by many.
    - of the CPU, allows users to run as many concurrent processes as they would like (cost performance, each process will run slowly if the CPU is shared).

**Modularity**
    - modularity means breaking a program into smaller, self-contained parts (called modules), so each part can be developed, fixed, or reused independently.

**Polices**
    - Def: algorithms for making some kind of decision within the OS.

**What constitutes a process?**
    - we have to understand it's machine state: what a program can read or update when it's running. At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execution of this program?
    - Memory that the process can address (called its address space) is part of the process.
    - registers; many instructions read or update registers and thus they are important to the execution of the process.

**How does the OS get a program up and running**
    - ![Loading: From Program To Process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13b97174-0c14-48c4-9ab8-4d2b7bf2119b).
    - load its code and any static data into memory into the address space of the process.
    - the process of loading a program and static data into memory requires the OS to read those bytes from disk and place them into memory somewhere.
    - OS must do some work to get the important program bits from disk into memory.
    - OS needs to allocate some memory for the programs stack (used for local variables, function parameters, and return addresses).
    - OS also needs to allocate memory for the programs heap (used for dynamically-allocated data -- e.g. data structure: linked list, trees, etc...).
    - OS initializes tasks, particularly as related to input/output(I/O) set.

**States a Process can be in at any given time**
    - **Running**: running on a processor. Means it is executing instructions.
    - **Ready**: Ready to run, but OS has chosen not to run at this given moment.
    - **Blocked**: performed some kind of operation that makes it not read to run until some other even takes place.
        - A process can be blocked during I/O (Input/Output) operations because of how operating systems manage resource access and scheduling. When a process performs I/O, such as reading from a file, requesting data over a network, or writing to a disk, it has to wait for the I/O operation to complete before it can continue its execution. This waiting period is what causes the process to be blocked.
    - Being moved from ready to running means the process has been **scheduled**.
    - Being moved from running to ready means the process has been **rescheduled**.
    - Process moves from Blocked to running.

**OS Scheduler**
    - The OS scheduler is a part of the operating system that manages the execution of processes.
    - It decides which process (task) should run, when, and for how long. 
    - The goal is to ensure that the CPU (central processing unit) is used efficiently by switching between processes, giving each one a fair amount of time to execute.
    - In short, OS scheduler keeps things running smoothly by quickly switching between tasks so that everything works as efficiently as possible!

- APIs available in a modern OS:
  - Create, Destroy, Wait, Miscellaneous Control, Status
- Input/Output -> I/O
